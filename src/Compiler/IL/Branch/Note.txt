Well Here are some IL's who just differ in Signed and Unsigned...So what is it
Well they are almost identical and doesn't matter too much but for more accuracy
I googled and i got to know the about different jump instruction
http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/x86-jumps.html

The Unsigned Jump Instruction are :-
JB			Jump if below
JNAE		Jump if not above or equal
JC			Jump if carry

JNB			Jump if not below
JAE			Jump if above or equal
JNC			Jump if not carry

JBE			Jump if below or equal 
JNA			Jump if not above
JA			Jump if above 
JNBE		Jump if not below or equal

And the Signed Jump Instruction are :-
JL			Jump if less 
JNGE		Jump if not greater or equal

JGE			Jump if greater or equal 
JNL			Jump if not less

JLE			Jump if less or equal 
JNG			Jump if not greater

JG			Jump if greater 
JNLE		Jump if not less or equal

@Message:
1)	I was thinking Xor is better than Compare in Brfalse and Brtrue IL...But will try later
2)	I have used ECX register at some place...so for a good quality we do sure that its value is neither 0x1, 0x0
	else if the method throws error but still the ECX register contains 0x1, 0x0 than compiler
	thought no error is thrown so this is to be taken in mind
