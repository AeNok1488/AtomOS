4) @reaper.2334: You have to start from Compiler/ILCompiler Compiler.cs Just navigate to this file rest you will get to know from comments
5) @Sandeep: whatever links or resources i gave you just put it into a folder inside docs named as "resources"
6) Just Add other PS2 error detection, in my code i assume that there will not be anykind of error
	Code is in Driver/Input/misc.cs --> PS2_Cmd http://wiki.osdev.org/PS/2_Keyboard#Special_Bytes
7) @Splitty: Have to start on ACPI, the brief documentation is here http://www.acpi.info/DOWNLOADS/ACPIspec50.pdf
	The documentation is very brief but bit long, so have to read througly first, i'll also try to finish it soon.
